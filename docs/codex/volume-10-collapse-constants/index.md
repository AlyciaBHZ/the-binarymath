# Volume 10 — Collapse Constant Systems

## Physical Constants from Golden-Base Structure

This volume demonstrates how all fundamental physical constants emerge naturally from the spectral and structural properties of φ-constrained collapse systems. The fine structure constant, π, e, and others arise from trace resonances and path statistics.
