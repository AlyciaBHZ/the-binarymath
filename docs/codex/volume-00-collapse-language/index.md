# Volume 0 — The Collapse Language

## Foundation of Binary Existence and φ-Constrained Language

This volume establishes the fundamental language of collapse, built on binary existence with the golden constraint (no consecutive 11s). From the self-referential origin ψ = ψ(ψ), we develop the complete formal language system that underlies all subsequent mathematics.

## Chapter Index

### [Chapter 000: SelfCollapse](./chapter-000-self-collapse.md)
**ψ = ψ(ψ) as the Origin of All Structure**

The foundational chapter establishing self-referential collapse as the origin of all mathematical structure. Introduces the fundamental equation and its implications.

### [Chapter 001: BitExistence](./chapter-001-bit-existence.md)
**Binary Information as Ontological Foundation**

Establishes binary \{0, 1\} as the fundamental unit of existence. Shows how all reality emerges from binary information under constraints.

### [Chapter 002: PhiAlphabet](./chapter-002-phi-alphabet.md)
**Defining Σφ = \{00, 01, 10\} as the Collapse-Safe Language**

Introduces the φ-alphabet by excluding 11 to prevent structural collapse. The foundation of all safe trace construction.

### [Chapter 003: TraceGrammar](./chapter-003-trace-grammar.md)
**Syntax Trees over φ-Constrained Trace Compositions**

Develops the grammatical rules for composing valid traces from the φ-alphabet. Establishes syntax for structural expressions.

### [Chapter 004: ZForm](./chapter-004-z-form.md)
**Zeckendorf Decomposition as Canonical Collapse Blueprint**

Shows how every natural number has a unique representation as sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers, establishing canonical forms.

### [Chapter 005: HSEncode](./chapter-005-hs-encode.md)
**Hurt–Sada Differential Encoding of Trace Pathways**

Introduces differential encoding schemes that preserve the φ-constraint while enabling efficient trace representation.

### [Chapter 006: PhiRank](./chapter-006-phi-rank.md)
**Dimensional Lifting of Collapse Traces into Tensor Fields**

Develops the concept of φ-rank, showing how traces lift into higher-dimensional tensor structures.

### [Chapter 007: TraceMachine](./chapter-007-trace-machine.md)
**Automata for Collapse-Valid φ-Language Recognition**

Constructs finite state machines that recognize and generate valid φ-language expressions.

### [Chapter 008: CollapseToken](./chapter-008-collapse-token.md)
**Structural Symbol Generator for φ-Based Parsing**

Develops tokenization schemes for parsing collapse expressions into structural components.

### [Chapter 009: TraceLexicon](./chapter-009-trace-lexicon.md)
**Minimal Collapse Vocabulary and Valid Expression Fragments**

Establishes the minimal vocabulary needed for expressing all collapse structures.

### [Chapter 010: NestCollapse](./chapter-010-nest-collapse.md)
**Self-Embedded Trace Folding and Recursive Grammar**

Shows how traces can embed within themselves, creating recursive grammatical structures.

### [Chapter 011: CollapseCompress](./chapter-011-collapse-compress.md)
**Entropy-Bounded φ-Trace Optimization Algorithms**

Develops compression algorithms that maintain φ-constraint while minimizing entropy.

### [Chapter 012: SyntaxTree](./chapter-012-syntax-tree.md)
**Hierarchical Collapse Expression Trees for Tensor Construction**

Constructs syntax trees that represent collapse expressions hierarchically.

### [Chapter 013: AlphabetGen](./chapter-013-alphabet-gen.md)
**Procedural Construction of Σφ-Conformant Trace Units**

Algorithms for generating valid trace units procedurally while maintaining constraints.

### [Chapter 014: GrammarClassify](./chapter-014-grammar-classify.md)
**Collapse Grammar Equivalence over Structural Path Spaces**

Classification of grammatical structures and their equivalence relations.

### [Chapter 015: CollapseMetric](./chapter-015-collapse-metric.md)
**Defining Distance and Dissimilarity over Trace Topology**

Introduces metric structures for measuring distances between collapse traces.
