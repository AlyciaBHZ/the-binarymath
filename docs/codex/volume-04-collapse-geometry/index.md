# Volume 4 — Geometry of Collapse Traces

## Spatial Structure from Golden-Base Constraints

This volume develops geometry entirely from trace relationships. Distance, curvature, and topology emerge from the fundamental constraint that no two 1s can be adjacent, creating a unique geometric framework.
