# Volume 9 — Measurement Geometry and Decoherence

## Quantum Measurement in Golden-Base Reality

This volume explores how measurement works in φ-constrained systems. Measurement becomes the interaction between observer tensors and trace structures, creating collapse events that transform both observer and observed.
