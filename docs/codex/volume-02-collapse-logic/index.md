# Volume 2 — Collapse Sets, Logic, and Predicate Paths

## Logic and Set Theory in φ-Constrained Space

This volume constructs set theory and logic entirely within the golden-base binary framework. Sets become clusters of collapse paths, membership is reachability, and logical operations respect the no-11 constraint throughout.

## Chapter Index

### [Chapter 032: SetBundle](./chapter-032-set-bundle.md)
**Collapse Path Clusters as φ-Structural Sets**

Defines sets as bundles of related collapse paths, creating a new foundation for set theory.

### [Chapter 033: ReachIn](./chapter-033-reach-in.md)
**Membership via Collapse Reachability Constraints**

Membership is redefined as whether one trace can reach another through valid transformations.

### [Chapter 034: SetOverlay](./chapter-034-set-overlay.md)
**Union and Intersection via Path Bundle Superposition**

Set operations through overlaying and intersecting trace path bundles.

### [Chapter 035: TraceMap](./chapter-035-trace-map.md)
**Function as Collapse-Preserving Tensor Routing**

Functions become trace-to-trace mappings that preserve structural constraints.

### [Chapter 036: CollapseCompose](./chapter-036-collapse-compose.md)
**Compositional Mapping via Trace Chain Propagation**

Function composition through chaining collapse transformations.

### [Chapter 037: PredTrace](./chapter-037-pred-trace.md)
**Logical Predicate as φ-Constrained Structural Selector**

Predicates select traces based on structural properties.

### [Chapter 038: TruthEval](./chapter-038-truth-eval.md)
**Observer-Relative Evaluation over Collapse Structures**

Truth becomes observer-dependent evaluation of trace configurations.

### [Chapter 039: QuantCollapse](./chapter-039-quant-collapse.md)
**∀ / ∃ Quantification over Collapse Path Spaces**

Universal and existential quantifiers range over trace structures.

### [Chapter 040: LogicTensor](./chapter-040-logic-tensor.md)
**Structural Logic Connectives on Tensor Combinators**

Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) as tensor transformations.

### [Chapter 041: ImplCollapse](./chapter-041-impl-collapse.md)
**Conditional Implication in Collapse Trace Systems**

Implication as structural entailment between trace states.

### [Chapter 042: ConsistentTrace](./chapter-042-consistent-trace.md)
**Logical Consistency via φ-Coherent Structure Composition**

Consistency means maintaining φ-constraint across logical operations.

### [Chapter 043: CollapseDeduce](./chapter-043-collapse-deduce.md)
**Deductive Path Expansion under Constraint Entailment**

Deduction as controlled expansion of trace paths.

### [Chapter 044: TruthNet](./chapter-044-truth-net.md)
**Collapse-Aware Tensor Truth Table Generator**

Truth tables in tensor form respecting structural constraints.

### [Chapter 045: LogicCircuit](./chapter-045-logic-circuit.md)
**Constructing φ-Binary Circuits from Trace Primitives**

Logic circuits built from golden-base components.

### [Chapter 046: CollapseSAT](./chapter-046-collapse-sat.md)
**Trace-Constrained Structural Satisfiability**

SAT problems in the context of φ-constrained structures.

### [Chapter 047: ModalCollapse](./chapter-047-modal-collapse.md)
**Trace Modalities over Structure Observer Frames**

Modal logic with necessity and possibility defined by trace reachability.

## Key Concepts Introduced

1. **Path Bundle Sets**: Sets as collections of collapse paths
2. **Reachability Membership**: ∈ as trace reachability
3. **Tensor Logic**: Logical operations as tensor transformations
4. **Observer Truth**: Truth relative to observer perspective
5. **Structural Consistency**: φ-constraint preservation
6. **Modal Traces**: Necessity and possibility in trace space

## Dependencies

- **Volume 0**: Core language and trace grammar
- **Volume 1**: Trace arithmetic for quantification

## Next Steps

- **Volume 3**: Build algebraic structures on this logic
- **Volume 6**: Extend to meta-logic and self-reference
- **Volume 7**: Connect to observer systems
