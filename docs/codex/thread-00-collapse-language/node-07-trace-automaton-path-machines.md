# ΨB-T0.N7: Trace Automaton and Path Machines

> *Computational models emerging from collapse dynamics*

## Understanding Computation Through Collapse

From ψ = ψ(ψ), the dimensional hierarchy, and vector operations, we now derive how computation naturally emerges as directed collapse through state space.

```mermaid
graph TD
    PSI["ψ = ψ(ψ)"] --> STATES["State transitions"]
    STATES --> PATHS["Directed paths"]
    PATHS --> AUTO["Automaton structure"]
    AUTO --> COMP["Computation model"]
    COMP --> MACHINE["Path machines"]
```

## First Principle: Computation as Collapse Navigation

**Theorem 7.1** (Computational Necessity): Any directed sequence of collapse operations constitutes computation.

*Proof*:
From the fundamental recursion, each application of ψ transforms state:

```mermaid
graph LR
    INPUT["Initial ψ₀"] --> TRANS1["ψ₁ = ψ(ψ₀)"]
    TRANS1 --> TRANS2["ψ₂ = ψ(ψ₁)"]
    TRANS2 --> TRANSN["ψₙ = ψ(ψₙ₋₁)"]
    TRANSN --> OUTPUT["Final state"]
    
    INPUT --> COMPUTE["Computation = Path"]
    OUTPUT --> COMPUTE
```

This sequence defines computation. ∎

## Formal Automaton Definition

**Definition 7.1** (Collapse Trace Automaton): A 5-tuple CTA = (Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F) where:
- Q = collapse states (valid sequences from {00, 01, 10})
- Σ = {00, 01, 10} (input alphabet)
- δ: Q × Σ → Q (transition function respecting grammar)
- q₀ = initial state (typically empty or 00)
- F ⊆ Q (accepting states)

**Theorem 7.2** (Grammar-Constrained Transitions): The transition function δ must respect collapse grammar rules.

*Proof*:
Invalid transitions violate the entropic wall:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    Empty --> S00: "00"
    S00 --> S00_00: "00"
    S00 --> S00_01: "01"
    S00 --> S00_10: "10"
    
    S00_01 --> Invalid1: "10 (creates 11)"
    S00_01 --> S00_01_01: "01"
    S00_01 --> S00_01_00: "00"
    
    S00_10 --> S00_10_00: "00"
    S00_10 --> S00_10_01: "01"
    S00_10 --> S00_10_10: "10"
    
    S01 --> Invalid2: "10 (creates 11)"
    S01 --> S01_01: "01"
    S01 --> S01_00: "00"
    
    note right of Invalid1: "01|10 contains 11"
    note right of Invalid2: "01|10 contains 11"
```

## Path Machine Architecture

**Definition 7.2** (Path Machine): A computational device that processes collapse sequences by navigating Zeckendorf paths.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Path Machine Components"
        TAPE["Input tape: collapse sequence"]
        HEAD["Read/write head"]
        STATE["Current φ-rank state"]
        TABLE["Transition table"]
    end
    
    TAPE --> HEAD
    HEAD --> STATE
    STATE --> TABLE
    TABLE --> ACTION["Next state + output"]
    ACTION --> HEAD
```

## Computational Power Analysis

**Theorem 7.3** (Turing Equivalence): Path machines with unbounded tape are Turing-complete.

*Proof sketch*:
1. Encode Turing machine states as collapse sequences
2. Map transitions to grammar-valid paths
3. Use φ-rank for hierarchical state organization

```mermaid
graph LR
    TM["Turing Machine"] --> ENCODE["State encoding"]
    ENCODE --> COLLAPSE["Collapse sequences"]
    COLLAPSE --> PATHS["Valid paths"]
    PATHS --> SIMULATE["Full simulation"]
    
    SIMULATE --> COMPLETE["Turing-complete"]
```

The grammar constraints don't limit computational power. ∎

## Visual Trace Execution

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Execution Trace"
        T0["t=0: 00"] --> T1["t=1: 00 01"]
        T1 --> T2["t=2: 00 01 10"]
        T2 --> T3["t=3: 00 01 10 00"]
        T3 --> T4["t=4: 00 01 10 00 01"]
    end
    
    subgraph "State Evolution"
        Q0["q₀"] --> Q1["q₁"]
        Q1 --> Q2["q₂"]
        Q2 --> Q3["q₃"]
        Q3 --> Q4["q₄"]
    end
    
    T0 -.-> Q0
    T1 -.-> Q1
    T2 -.-> Q2
    T3 -.-> Q3
    T4 -.-> Q4
```

## Algorithmic Properties

**Definition 7.3** (Trace Complexity): The complexity of a computation is:

$$
C(w) = \sum_{i=1}^{|w|} \phi^{\text{rank}(s_i)}
$$

where sᵢ are intermediate states.

**Theorem 7.4** (Optimal Path Algorithm): Dijkstra's algorithm on the collapse graph finds minimal-complexity paths.

```mermaid
graph LR
    START["Start state"] --> GRAPH["Build state graph"]
    GRAPH --> WEIGHT["Weight by φ-rank"]
    WEIGHT --> DIJKSTRA["Run Dijkstra"]
    DIJKSTRA --> OPTIMAL["Optimal path"]
    
    OPTIMAL --> MIN["Minimum complexity"]
```

## Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic

**Definition 7.4** (Non-Deterministic Path Machine): Allows multiple valid transitions from each state.

```mermaid
graph TD
    STATE["Current: 10"] --> CHOICE{{"Choice point"}}
    CHOICE --> PATH1["Add 00"]
    CHOICE --> PATH2["Add 01"]
    
    PATH1 --> RESULT1["10 00"]
    PATH2 --> RESULT2["10 01"]
    
    RESULT1 --> ACCEPT1["Both valid"]
    RESULT2 --> ACCEPT1
```

**Theorem 7.5** (NP-Completeness): Path satisfiability in collapse space is NP-complete.

## Memory Models

**Definition 7.5** (Stack-Based Path Machine): Uses φ-rank as natural stack structure.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Stack Operations"
        PUSH["Push: increase rank"]
        POP["Pop: decrease rank"]
        TOP["Top: current rank"]
    end
    
    PUSH --> RANK["φ-rank operations"]
    POP --> RANK
    TOP --> RANK
    
    RANK --> MEMORY["Natural memory hierarchy"]
```

## Parallel Path Machines

**Theorem 7.6** (Parallel Decomposition): Independent paths can be computed in parallel.

*Proof*:
Non-interfering paths through collapse space:

```mermaid
graph LR
    INPUT["Input"] --> SPLIT["Decompose"]
    
    SPLIT --> P1["Path 1"]
    SPLIT --> P2["Path 2"]
    SPLIT --> P3["Path 3"]
    
    P1 --> MERGE["Combine results"]
    P2 --> MERGE
    P3 --> MERGE
    
    MERGE --> OUTPUT["Output"]
    
    style P1 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style P2 fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style P3 fill:#99f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Connection to Quantum Computing

**Theorem 7.7** (Quantum Path Superposition): Path machines naturally support quantum-like superposition.

*Proof*:
Multiple paths can be in superposition:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|path_1\rangle + \beta|path_2\rangle + \gamma|path_3\rangle
$$

```mermaid
graph TD
    SUPER["Superposition state"] --> PATHS["Multiple paths"]
    PATHS --> COLLAPSE["Measurement collapses"]
    COLLAPSE --> SINGLE["Single path selected"]
    
    SINGLE --> QUANTUM["Quantum behavior"]
```

## Halting and Decidability

**Definition 7.6** (Trace Halting): A path machine halts when reaching a fixpoint state.

**Theorem 7.8** (Decidable Subclasses): Bounded φ-rank machines have decidable halting.

```mermaid
graph LR
    BOUNDED["Rank ≤ k"] --> FINITE["Finite states"]
    FINITE --> CYCLE["Must cycle"]
    CYCLE --> DETECT["Cycle detection"]
    DETECT --> DECIDABLE["Halting decidable"]
```

## Practical Implementation

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Implementation Layers"
        L1["Grammar validator"]
        L2["State transition engine"]
        L3["Path optimizer"]
        L4["Execution monitor"]
    end
    
    L1 --> L2
    L2 --> L3
    L3 --> L4
    
    L4 --> OUTPUT["Computation result"]
```

## Applications of Path Machines

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Detecting collapse patterns in data
2. **Optimization**: Finding minimal-complexity solutions
3. **Cryptography**: Path-based encryption schemes
4. **AI/ML**: Learning optimal paths through experience

## The Eighth Echo

We have rigorously derived how computation emerges naturally from directed navigation through collapse state space. Path machines are not arbitrary constructs but necessary consequences of the grammar-constrained transitions between states. These machines achieve Turing-completeness while maintaining the elegant structure of φ-ranked paths, enabling both classical and quantum-like computation within a unified framework.

The next node will explore how symbols can be systematically expanded according to collapse rules.

*Thus: Node 7 = Computation = Navigation(Paths) = Machine(Collapse)*
