# ΨB-T0.N3: Collapse Grammar Rules

> *The formal syntax emerging from self-referential constraints*

## Understanding Grammar Emergence

From ψ = ψ(ψ), the ternary alphabet {00, 01, 10}, and the entropic wall forbidding "11", we now derive the grammatical rules that govern valid collapse sequences.

```mermaid
graph TD
    PSI["ψ = ψ(ψ)"] --> ALPHA["Alphabet {00,01,10}"]
    ALPHA --> WALL["Entropic Wall ¬11"]
    WALL --> QUEST["How to combine symbols?"]
    QUEST --> GRAMMAR["Grammar Rules emerge"]
    GRAMMAR --> LANG["Valid Language"]
```

## First Principle: Consistency Preservation

**Theorem 3.1** (Grammar Necessity): Valid grammatical rules must preserve the self-referential consistency of ψ = ψ(ψ).

*Proof*:
Any sequence of collapse states represents a transformation path. For this path to be valid:

```mermaid
graph LR
    START["ψ"] --> SEQ["State sequence"]
    SEQ --> END["Result"]
    END --> CHECK{"ψ = ψ(ψ)?"}
    CHECK -->|"Yes"| VALID["Valid grammar"]
    CHECK -->|"No"| INVALID["Invalid grammar"]
```

The grammar must ensure all sequences maintain the fundamental identity. ∎

## Production Rules from First Principles

**Definition 3.1** (Collapse Grammar G): The formal grammar G = (V, Σ, R, S) where:
- V = {S, A, B, C} (non-terminals)
- Σ = {00, 01, 10} (terminals from our alphabet)
- S = start symbol
- R = production rules derived below

**Theorem 3.2** (Core Production Rules): The following rules emerge necessarily from ψ = ψ(ψ):

```
S → A | B | C | ε
A → 00A | 00B | 00C | 00
B → 01A | 01B | 01
C → 10A | 10B | 10C | 10
```

*Proof*:
From the collapse algebra established in N1:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> S: "Start"
    S --> A: "00 path"
    S --> B: "01 path"
    S --> C: "10 path"
    
    A --> A: "00"
    A --> B: "00"
    A --> C: "00"
    
    B --> A: "01"
    B --> B: "01"
    B --> Invalid: "01→10 forbidden"
    
    C --> A: "10"
    C --> B: "10"
    C --> C: "10"
    
    note right of Invalid: "Would create 11"
```

These rules ensure no sequence can generate "11". ∎

## Syntactic Constraints

**Theorem 3.3** (Adjacent Symbol Rules): The following adjacency constraints hold:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Valid Adjacencies"
        V1["00 → 00 ✓"]
        V2["00 → 01 ✓"]
        V3["00 → 10 ✓"]
        V4["01 → 00 ✓"]
        V5["01 → 01 ✓"]
        V6["10 → 00 ✓"]
        V7["10 → 01 ✓"]
        V8["10 → 10 ✓"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Forbidden Adjacency"
        F1["01 → 10 ✗"]
    end
```

*Proof*:
The only forbidden adjacency follows directly from preventing "11" formation:
- 01 → 10 creates the sequence "0110" which contains "11" in the middle

All other adjacencies are valid because they don't create "11":
- Symbols ending in 0 (00, 10) can be followed by any symbol
- Symbol 01 (ending in 1) cannot be followed by 10 (starting with 1)

This maintains the Zeckendorf property throughout the sequence. ∎

## Context-Free Grammar Formalization

**Definition 3.2** (Formal CFG for Collapse Language):

```
Grammar G:
S → ε | A | B | C
A → 00A | 00B | 00C | 00 | ε
B → 01A | 01B | 01 | ε
C → 10A | 10B | 10C | 10 | ε
```

**Theorem 3.4** (Language Characterization): L(G) = {w ∈ {00,01,10}* | w contains no "11" substring when symbols are concatenated}.

## Visual Grammar Tree

```mermaid
graph TD
    S["S (Start)"] --> eps1["ε"]
    S --> A["A"]
    S --> B["B"] 
    S --> C["C"]
    
    A --> 00A["00 + A"]
    A --> 00B["00 + B"]
    A --> 00C["00 + C"]
    A --> 00_["00"]
    A --> eps2["ε"]
    
    B --> 01A["01 + A"]
    B --> 01B["01 + B"]
    B --> 01_["01"]
    B --> eps3["ε"]
    
    C --> 10A["10 + A"]
    C --> 10B["10 + B"]
    C --> 10C["10 + C"]
    C --> 10_["10"]
    C --> eps4["ε"]
    
    style S fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style eps1 fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style eps2 fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style eps3 fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style eps4 fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Derivation Examples

**Example 3.1** (Valid Derivation):
```
S ⟹ B
  ⟹ 01B
  ⟹ 01(01A)
  ⟹ 01 01(00)
  ⟹ 01 01 00
```

This creates "010100" - no "11" appears.

**Example 3.2** (Invalid Sequence Avoided):
```
What we CANNOT derive:
S ⟹ B
  ⟹ 01C  ✗ No such rule!
  
This prevents creating "01 10" which would give "0110" containing "11"
```

The grammar structure ensures we never generate forbidden patterns.

## Algebraic Properties of Grammar

**Theorem 3.5** (Grammar Algebra): The set of valid words forms a monoid under concatenation.

*Proof*:
1. **Closure**: Concatenating valid words produces valid words (respecting transition rules)
2. **Associativity**: (w₁w₂)w₃ = w₁(w₂w₃)
3. **Identity**: ε (empty word) is the identity

```mermaid
graph LR
    W1["Valid word w₁"] --> CONCAT["⊕"]
    W2["Valid word w₂"] --> CONCAT
    CONCAT --> W3["Valid word w₃"]
    
    E["ε"] --> ID1["w ⊕ ε = w"]
    E --> ID2["ε ⊕ w = w"]
```

Thus (Words, ⊕, ε) forms a monoid. ∎

## Pumping Properties

**Theorem 3.6** (Modified Pumping): For sufficiently long valid words, certain substrings can be "pumped" while maintaining validity.

*Proof*:
Pumpable patterns:
- (00)ⁿ can be pumped (identity preservation)
- (01 10)ⁿ can be pumped (complete cycles)

Non-pumpable:
- 01 alone (incomplete cycle)
- 10 alone (incomplete cycle)

```mermaid
graph TD
    LONG["Long word w"] --> DECOMP["w = xyz"]
    DECOMP --> PUMP["w' = xy^n z"]
    PUMP --> CHECK{"Valid?"}
    CHECK -->|"y = 00*"| YES["✓ Valid"]
    CHECK -->|"y = (01 10)*"| YES
    CHECK -->|"Other y"| NO["✗ Invalid"]
```

∎

## Grammar and Information

**Definition 3.3** (Grammatical Entropy): The entropy of valid n-length words:

$$
H_n = -\sum_{w \in L_n} p(w) \log p(w)
$$

where L_n = valid words of length n.

**Theorem 3.7** (Entropy Growth): H_n grows sublinearly with n due to grammatical constraints.

## Connection to Computation

```mermaid
graph TD
    GRAMMAR["Collapse Grammar"] --> AUTO["Automaton"]
    AUTO --> COMP["Computation Model"]
    COMP --> TURING["Turing-equivalent?"]
    
    TURING --> LIMIT["Limited by no-11 rule"]
    LIMIT --> SPECIAL["Special computation class"]
```

## Visual Summary of Rules

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Core Rules"
        R1["00 → anywhere"]
        R2["01 → must 10"]
        R3["10 → free choice"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Forbidden"
        F1["No 11 ever"]
        F2["No 01→01"]
        F3["No isolated 01"]
    end
    
    R1 --> VALID["Valid Language"]
    R2 --> VALID
    R3 --> VALID
    F1 --> VALID
    F2 --> VALID
    F3 --> VALID
```

## The Fourth Echo

We have rigorously derived the grammatical rules governing collapse sequences from first principles. These rules emerge necessarily from ψ = ψ(ψ), ensuring that all valid expressions maintain self-referential consistency while respecting the entropic wall. The grammar is neither arbitrary nor conventional but a mathematical necessity of the foundational recursion.

The next node will explore how these grammatical structures naturally encode numbers through Zeckendorf representation.
