# ΨB-T0.N8: Collapse Symbol Expansion Rules

> *Systematic unfolding of compressed collapse representations*

## Understanding Expansion from Compression

From ψ = ψ(ψ), path machines, and the computational model, we now derive how symbols can be systematically expanded to reveal their full collapse structure.

```mermaid
graph TD
    PSI["ψ = ψ(ψ)"] --> COMPACT["Compact forms"]
    COMPACT --> RULES["Expansion rules"]
    RULES --> UNFOLD["Systematic unfolding"]
    UNFOLD --> FULL["Full representation"]
    FULL --> MEANING["Complete meaning"]
```

## First Principle: Expansion as Inverse Collapse

**Theorem 8.1** (Expansion Necessity): Every collapsed form must have a unique expansion revealing its construction.

*Proof*:
From the self-referential nature of ψ = ψ(ψ):

```mermaid
graph LR
    COLLAPSED["ψ (collapsed)"] --> EXPAND["Expansion process"]
    EXPAND --> REVEALED["ψ(ψ) structure"]
    
    REVEALED --> VERIFY["ψ(ψ) = ψ ✓"]
    
    style COLLAPSED fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style REVEALED fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Expansion reveals the implicit self-application. ∎

## Formal Expansion Rules

**Definition 8.1** (Symbol Expansion System): A rewriting system E = (Σ, R) where:
- Σ = {00, 01, 10} ∪ {macro symbols}
- R = expansion rules preserving collapse grammar

**Theorem 8.2** (Core Expansion Rules): The fundamental expansions are:

```
Ω → 00           (identity expansion)
Δ → 01 10        (cycle expansion)
Φ → 00 01 10     (complete trace)
Ξ → Φ Φ          (double trace)
```

*Proof*:
Each rule unfolds a conceptual unit into its trace components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Macro Symbols"
        M1["Ω = identity"]
        M2["Δ = transform-return"]
        M3["Φ = full cycle"]
        M4["Ξ = double cycle"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Expansions"
        E1["00"]
        E2["01 10"]
        E3["00 01 10"]
        E4["00 01 10 00 01 10"]
    end
    
    M1 --> E1
    M2 --> E2
    M3 --> E3
    M4 --> E4
```

## Recursive Expansion Patterns

**Definition 8.2** (Nested Expansion): Symbols can contain other symbols requiring recursive expansion.

```mermaid
graph LR
    LEVEL1["Ψ = Φ[Δ]"] --> LEVEL2["Ψ = (00 01 10)[01 10]"]
    LEVEL2 --> LEVEL3["Ψ = 00 01 10 01 10"]
    
    LEVEL1 --> REC["Recursive process"]
    LEVEL3 --> REC
```

**Theorem 8.3** (Termination): All finite symbol expansions terminate.

*Proof*:
Each expansion increases sequence length by finite amount. No infinite loops possible with finite alphabet. ∎

## Fibonacci-Based Expansions

**Definition 8.3** (φ-Expansion): Expansions following Fibonacci growth patterns:

```
F₁ → 00
F₂ → 00 01
F₃ → 00 01 10 00
F₅ → 00 01 10 00 01 00 01 10
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    F1["F₁"] --> EXP1["Length 2"]
    F2["F₂"] --> EXP2["Length 4"]
    F3["F₃"] --> EXP3["Length 8"]
    F5["F₅"] --> EXP5["Length 16"]
    
    EXP1 --> PATTERN["2ⁿ growth pattern"]
    EXP2 --> PATTERN
    EXP3 --> PATTERN
    EXP5 --> PATTERN
```

## Context-Sensitive Expansion

**Theorem 8.4** (Context Dependency): Some expansions depend on surrounding context.

*Proof*:
Consider expansion in different contexts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Context A"
        A1["00 Δ 00"] --> A2["00 01 10 00"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Context B"
        B1["01 Δ"] --> B2["01 (forbidden)"]
    end
    
    A2 --> VALID["Valid expansion"]
    B2 --> INVALID["Invalid by grammar"]
    
    style INVALID fill:#f99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Context determines valid expansions. ∎

## Algorithmic Expansion

**Algorithm 8.1** (Left-to-Right Expansion):

```mermaid
graph TD
    INPUT["Symbol sequence"] --> SCAN["Scan left-to-right"]
    SCAN --> FIND{{"Macro symbol?"}}
    FIND -->|"Yes"| EXPAND["Apply rule"]
    FIND -->|"No"| NEXT["Move right"]
    
    EXPAND --> CHECK{{"Valid context?"}}
    CHECK -->|"Yes"| REPLACE["Replace symbol"]
    CHECK -->|"No"| SKIP["Skip expansion"]
    
    REPLACE --> SCAN
    SKIP --> NEXT
    NEXT --> MORE{{"More symbols?"}}
    MORE -->|"Yes"| SCAN
    MORE -->|"No"| OUTPUT["Expanded form"]
```

## Expansion Complexity

**Definition 8.4** (Expansion Complexity): The computational cost of full expansion:

$$
C_E(s) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |R_i| \cdot \phi^{\text{depth}(i)}
$$

where |Rᵢ| is rule size and depth is nesting level.

**Theorem 8.5** (Exponential Growth): Deeply nested symbols can have exponential expansion.

```mermaid
graph LR
    NEST1["Ψ₁ = Φ[Φ]"] --> SIZE1["Size: 9"]
    NEST2["Ψ₂ = Φ[Φ[Φ]]"] --> SIZE2["Size: 27"]
    NEST3["Ψ₃ = Φ[Φ[Φ[Φ]]]"] --> SIZE3["Size: 81"]
    
    SIZE1 --> GROWTH["3ⁿ growth"]
    SIZE2 --> GROWTH
    SIZE3 --> GROWTH
```

## Normal Form Expansions

**Definition 8.5** (Canonical Expansion): The unique fully-expanded form with no macros.

```mermaid
graph TD
    MACRO["Macro form"] --> PARTIAL["Partial expansions"]
    PARTIAL --> FULL["Full expansion"]
    FULL --> CANONICAL["Canonical form"]
    
    CANONICAL --> UNIQUE["Unique representation"]
```

**Theorem 8.6** (Confluence): All expansion orders lead to same canonical form.

## Compression via Reverse Expansion

**Definition 8.6** (Pattern Compression): Identifying repeated patterns for macro substitution.

```mermaid
graph LR
    LONG["00 01 10 00 01 10"] --> DETECT["Pattern detection"]
    DETECT --> PATTERN["'00 01 10' repeats"]
    PATTERN --> COMPRESS["Replace with Ξ"]
    COMPRESS --> SHORT["Ξ"]
    
    style LONG fill:#f99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style SHORT fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Visual Expansion Trees

```mermaid
graph TD
    ROOT["Ξ[Δ,Ω]"] --> L1A["Ξ"]
    ROOT --> L1B["[Δ,Ω]"]
    
    L1A --> L2A["Φ Φ"]
    L1B --> L2B["Δ"]
    L1B --> L2C["Ω"]
    
    L2A --> L3A["00 01 10"]
    L2A --> L3B["00 01 10"]
    L2B --> L3C["01 10"]
    L2C --> L3D["00"]
    
    L3A --> FINAL["00 01 10 00 01 10 01 10 00"]
    L3B --> FINAL
    L3C --> FINAL
    L3D --> FINAL
```

## Applications of Symbol Expansion

1. **Code Generation**: Expanding templates to full programs
2. **Data Decompression**: Reconstructing original sequences
3. **Proof Expansion**: Unfolding compressed mathematical arguments
4. **Language Processing**: Expanding abbreviations and macros

## Connection to Information Theory

**Theorem 8.7** (Information Preservation): Expansion preserves information content.

*Proof*:
$$
H(\text{macro form}) = H(\text{expanded form})
$$

```mermaid
graph LR
    MACRO["High density"] --> EXPAND["Expansion"]
    EXPAND --> FULL["Low density"]
    
    MACRO --> INFO["Same information"]
    FULL --> INFO
```

## Philosophical Implications

Symbol expansion reveals:

1. **Hidden Structure**: Compressed forms contain full complexity
2. **Fractal Nature**: Patterns repeat at multiple scales
3. **Computational Depth**: Simple symbols unfold to reveal depth
4. **Unity/Multiplicity**: One symbol contains many

## Connection to Subsequent Concepts

    N8["N8: Symbol Expansion"] --> N9["N9: Normal Forms"]
    N8 --> N10["N10: Folding"]
    N8 --> N11["N11: Compressibility"]
    
    N8 --> ENABLE["Enables:"]
    ENABLE --> NORM["Normalization"]
    ENABLE --> COMP["Compression"]
    ENABLE --> ANAL["Deep analysis"]
```

## The Ninth Echo

We have rigorously derived how symbols in collapse language can be systematically expanded to reveal their full structure. This expansion process is not arbitrary but follows necessarily from the self-referential nature of ψ = ψ(ψ), where compressed forms must contain their complete unfolding. The rules preserve grammatical validity while enabling exponential compression ratios through nested macro symbols.

The next node will explore how these expanded forms can be normalized into canonical representations.

*Thus: Node 8 = Expansion = Unfolding(Symbol) = Revelation(Structure)*
