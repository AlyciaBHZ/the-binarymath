## Â§2.1â€ƒDefinition: Zeckendorf Collapse Encoding

From Chapter 1, we defined the set $\mathcal{C}_\phi$ as the domain of all valid collapse paths recursively generated by Ïˆ.

We now define the **Zeckendorf Encoding** of each $x \in \mathcal{C}_\phi$ as a Ï†-based binary vector satisfying the no-consecutive-11 rule.

### Definition 2.1 (Zeckendorf Encoding Function)

Let the Fibonacci sequence be defined as:

$$
F_1 = 1,\quad F_2 = 2,\quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
$$

Then for any $x \in \mathbb{N}^+$, there exists a **unique representation**:

$$
x = \sum_{i} F_{k_i} \quad \text{where } k_{i+1} \geq k_i + 2
$$

Define the encoding function:

$$
Z_\phi : \mathbb{N}^+ \longrightarrow \{0,1\}^*
$$

such that:

* $Z_\phi(x)$ is the binary representation of x in Fibonacci basis;
* No two adjacent bits in $Z_\phi(x)$ are 1.

We write:

$$
\text{NoConsecutive11}(Z_\phi(x)) = \text{True}
\quad \forall x \in \mathcal{C}_\phi
$$

### Proposition 2.1 (Ïˆ Can Only Encode Non-Consecutive-11 Structures)

Let Ïˆ = Ïˆ(Ïˆ) be the self-generating collapse operator. Then:

$$
\psi \text{ may only construct elements } x \in \mathbb{N}^+ \text{ satisfying } \text{NoConsecutive11}(Z_\phi(x))
$$

**Reason:**

* If two adjacent 1â€™s occur in the collapse trace, then the path structure is non-minimal in entropy;
* Such overlapping traces violate collapse orthogonality (Ïˆ would generate structurally indistinct recursive paths);
* Hence, only **non-overlapping Ï†-trace collapse paths** are Ïˆ-constructible.

---

### Â§2.2â€ƒCollapse Path Category

Define the **Collapse Path Category** $\mathcal{C}at_\phi$ as follows:

* Objects: $Z_\phi(x) \in \{0,1\}^*$ satisfying the no-11 constraint;
* Morphisms: collapse operations between paths (e.g., extension, reduction, composition);
* Each object corresponds to a unique collapse path from Ïˆ.

We write:

$$
\text{Objects}( \mathcal{C}at_\phi ) = \mathcal{C}_\phi
$$

---

### Lemma 2.2 (Ïˆ-Trace Self-Similarity)

Let $x, y \in \mathcal{C}_\phi$, and $Z_\phi(x), Z_\phi(y)$ be their collapse encodings. Then:

$$
\text{If } Z_\phi(x) \text{ is a prefix of } Z_\phi(y),
\text{ then collapse(y)} \supseteq collapse(x)
$$

This reflects the recursive nature of Ïˆâ€™s self-replication across collapse trace networks.
