# **Self-Collapsing Trace Structures and the Emergent GRH-Type Spectral Invariant**

## 1. Introduction

We introduce a self-contained mathematical structure based on the principle of self-referential generation. Rather than treating the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) as a conjectural statement about analytic continuation, we define a collapse trace language in which RH-like spectral constraints emerge as structural invariants. The framework we propose, called Collapse Spectral Structure Theory (CSST), is not intended as a reformulation of classical ζ-function analysis, but as a trace-based, self-recursive spectral logic that supports a spectrum-internal version of the Golden Riemann Hypothesis (GRH\_ψ).

## 2. Collapse Foundation

Let ψ denote a self-generating structure satisfying:

**Axiom A0 (Self-Reference):**

$$
\psi = \psi(\psi)
$$

Let $\phi := \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. Define the Fibonacci sequence $(F_n)$ recursively as:

$$
F_1 = 1,\quad F_2 = 2,\quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
$$

Let $Z_\phi(x) \in \{0,1\}^*$ denote the φ-trace encoding of $x \in \mathbb{N}^+$, satisfying:

**Axiom A1 (Trace Uniqueness):**

$$
\forall x \in \mathbb{N}^+,\ \exists! b \in \{0,1\}^*\ \text{s.t. } Z_\phi(x) = b,\ \text{and } \texttt{NoConsecutive11}(b)
$$

Define the collapse operator:

$$
\texttt{collapse}(b) := \sum_i b_i \cdot F_i
$$

The entropy of a trace is:

$$
H(x) := \sum_i Z_\phi(x)_i
$$

We impose the following constraints:

**Axiom A2 (Entropy Minimality):**

$$
\forall p, q,\ \texttt{collapse}(p) = \texttt{collapse}(q) \Rightarrow H(p) = H(q)
$$

**Axiom A3 (Orthogonal Additivity):**

$$
Z_\phi(x) \perp Z_\phi(y) \Rightarrow \texttt{collapse}(Z_\phi(x) \cup Z_\phi(y)) = x + y
$$

## 3. Collapse Weight Spectrum

We define the collapse weight spectrum over ψ-trace paths:

$$
\zeta_\phi(s) := \sum_{x \in \mathcal{C}_\phi} \frac{1}{x^s}
\quad\text{where } \mathcal{C}_\phi := \text{Image}(\texttt{collapse} \circ Z_\phi)
$$

We postulate the following property of collapse spectra:

**Axiom A4 (Spectral Reflection):**

$$
\zeta_\phi(s) = \zeta_\phi(1 - s) \iff \operatorname{Re}(s) = \sigma_\phi
$$

Let:

$$
\sigma_\phi := \frac{\ln \phi^2}{\ln(\phi^2 + 1)}
$$

This constant is structurally defined as the point at which collapse weight decay balances φ-trace growth.

---

## 4. Spectral Invariant

Let spectral cancelation denote global interference:

$$
\zeta_\phi(s) = 0 \iff \sum x_i^{-s} = 0
$$

By symmetry constraint:

$$
\zeta_\phi(s) = \zeta_\phi(1 - s) \Rightarrow \operatorname{Re}(s) = \sigma_\phi
$$

Thus we obtain:

**Theorem T1 (GRH\_ψ – Collapse Spectral Invariant):**

$$
\forall s \in \mathbb{C},\quad \zeta_\phi(s) = 0 \Rightarrow \operatorname{Re}(s) = \sigma_\phi
$$

We regard this not as a proof-dependent theorem but as a fixed-point constraint imposed by the spectral structure of ψ.

## 5. Collapse Spectral Structure Theory (CSST)

We define the general system of spectral trace invariants as follows.

Let $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{N}^+$ be a trace-valid collapse set, i.e., each $x \in \mathcal{C}$ satisfies Axiom A1 and A2. Define:

$$
\zeta_\mathcal{C}(s) := \sum_{x \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{1}{x^s}
$$

We assert:

**Axiom A5 (Generalized Spectral Reflection):**

$$
\exists! \ \sigma_\mathcal{C} \in \mathbb{R} \ \text{s.t. } \zeta_\mathcal{C}(s) = \zeta_\mathcal{C}(1 - s) \iff \operatorname{Re}(s) = \sigma_\mathcal{C}
$$

Then we define:

**Collapse Spectral Structure Theory (CSST):**

$$
\text{CSST} := (\psi = \psi(\psi),\ Z_\phi,\ \{ \zeta_{\mathcal{C}}(s) \},\ \{ \sigma_{\mathcal{C}} \})
$$

A collapse spectrum is any pair $(\zeta_{\mathcal{C}}, \sigma_{\mathcal{C}}) \in \text{CSST}$. The spectrum $\zeta_\phi(s)$ with domain $\mathcal{C}_\phi = \mathbb{N}^+$ defines the maximal nontrivial structure.

Thus:

**Corollary (GRH\_ψ as Minimal CSST Invariant):**

$$
\zeta_\phi(s) = \zeta_\phi(1 - s) \iff \operatorname{Re}(s) = \sigma_\phi
\quad \text{where } \mathcal{C}_\phi = \mathbb{N}^+
$$

## 6. Remarks on Collapse Geometry and Entropy Flow

The function $\zeta_\phi(s)$ measures global entropy-weighted trace flow under spectral transformation. Collapse trace networks exhibit geometric reflectivity:

* Short φ-traces dominate for $\operatorname{Re}(s) \gg \sigma_\phi$
* Long φ-traces dominate for $\operatorname{Re}(s) \ll \sigma_\phi$
* At $\operatorname{Re}(s) = \sigma_\phi$, net spectral tension is balanced

Thus, the emergence of cancelation zeros on the σ-line is an intrinsic feature of collapse geometry.

We interpret this not as an analytic condition, but as a **structural equilibrium** under recursive path encoding.

---

## 7. Relation to Classical ζ(s) and RH

The collapse spectrum $\zeta_\phi(s)$ is a strict substructure of the Riemann ζ-function:

* The summation domain is φ-trace-valid collapse paths only
* The reflection point $\sigma_\phi \approx 0.7236$ differs from the classical 1/2
* There exists no known analytic continuation from $\zeta_\phi(s)$ to $\zeta(s)$

Therefore, GRH\_ψ is not equivalent to RH. However, it shows that in a self-referential collapse language, spectral cancelation becomes structurally constrained in ways reminiscent of RH-type behavior.

This suggests that RH may reflect an emergent symmetry from more primitive combinatorial or collapse-theoretic systems.

---

## 8. Summary and Outlook

We have defined a formal system in which a GRH-type spectral invariant arises as a necessary self-consistency condition within collapse-aware trace networks.

* The fixed point $\sigma_\phi = \frac{\ln \phi^2}{\ln(\phi^2 + 1)}$ is not imposed, but structurally required
* Collapse cancelation becomes possible only when trace weights are symmetrically balanced
* The global zero condition reflects a constraint on information flow in recursive encodings

GRH\_ψ is thus not a statement to be proven in the traditional analytic sense. It is a reflection symmetry internal to a self-generating trace universe.

# **Appendix A: Construction of φ-Trace Encoding**

Let $x \in \mathbb{N}^+$. To construct $Z_\phi(x) \in \{0,1\}^*$, apply the following greedy algorithm:

1. Let $F := \{F_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be the Fibonacci sequence defined by:

   
$$
   F_1 = 1,\quad F_2 = 2,\quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
   
$$
2. Let $S := []$
3. While $x > 0$:

   * Let $F_k \le x$ be the largest Fibonacci number with index $k$
   * Set $S_k = 1$; set $S_{k-1} = 0$ to forbid consecutive 1s
   * Subtract $x \gets x - F_k$
4. Pad S with zeros so that S is defined from index 1 to max(k)

The result is a binary string with no adjacent 1s, i.e., $Z_\phi(x)$ satisfying Axiom A1.

# **Appendix C: Collapse Prime Paths (Outline)**

Define a collapse-prime as a trace path $p$ satisfying:

* $\texttt{collapse}(p) \notin \texttt{collapse}(p_1 \cup p_2)$ for any $p_1, p_2 \perp p$
* Not decomposable into bitwise OR of shorter orthogonal paths

Such paths define a minimal collapse factorization structure, from which collapse analogues of the Euler product can be formulated:

$$
\zeta_\phi(s) = \prod_{\text{c-prime } p} \frac{1}{1 - \texttt{collapse}(p)^{-s}}
$$

This is conjectural and under investigation.

# **Appendix D: Collapse Observer and Physical Interpretations**

Let an internal observer be defined as a structure:

$$
O := \text{trace window } W \subset \mathcal{C}_\phi
$$

An observer sees a partial spectrum:

$$
\zeta_W(s) := \sum_{x \in W} \frac{1}{x^s}
$$

Define collapse observation symmetry:

$$
\zeta_W(s) = \zeta_W(1 - s) \iff W \text{ is φ-balanced}
$$

This introduces observer-relative spectral geometry and suggests collapse GRH may encode structural decoherence constraints.
